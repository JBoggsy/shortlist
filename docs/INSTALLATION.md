## Option A: Desktop App (Recommended)

The easiest way to use Job Application Helper is to download the desktop app. No programming tools required—just download, install, and run.

### Step 1: Download

Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper/releases) and download the installer for your operating system:

| Platform | File to Download | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Windows** | `.exe` or `.msi` | Choose `.msi` for a standard Windows installer |
| **macOS** | `.dmg` | Requires macOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer |
| **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)** | `.deb` | For Debian-based distributions |
| **Linux (Fedora/RHEL)** | `.rpm` | For Red Hat-based distributions |
| **Linux (Other)** | `.AppImage` | Works on most Linux distributions |

### Step 2: Install

**Windows:**
1. Double-click the downloaded `.exe` or `.msi` file
2. If you see a "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen) warning, click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"** — this appears because the app is not yet code-signed
3. Follow the installation prompts

**macOS:**
1. Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. Drag the app to your Applications folder
3. When you first open the app, you may see a warning that it's from an unidentified developer. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **"Open Anyway"**
   - This happens because the app is not yet code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate

**Linux (.deb):**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i job-app-helper_*.deb
```

**Linux (.rpm):**
```bash
sudo rpm -i job-app-helper-*.rpm
```

**Linux (.AppImage):**
```bash
chmod +x job-app-helper_*.AppImage
./job-app-helper_*.AppImage
```

### Step 3: Launch

1. Open the app from your Applications menu, Start menu, or desktop
2. On first launch, the **Settings** panel will open automatically — this is where you'll enter your API key
3. Continue to [Getting Your API Keys](#getting-your-api-keys) below

## First-Time Setup

When you open the app for the first time, a **Settings** panel will automatically open on the right side of the screen. This is where you'll enter your API keys.

### Entering Your Settings

The Settings panel has two main sections:

#### AI Assistant (LLM) - **Required**

This section configures the AI that powers the assistant.

1. **Provider**: Select your AI provider from the dropdown:
   - Anthropic Claude (Recommended)
   - OpenAI GPT
   - Google Gemini
   - Ollama (local, no API key needed)

2. **API Key**: Paste your API key here (the one you saved earlier)
   - This field won't show if you selected Ollama
   - Your key will be masked with asterisks for security

3. **Model Override** (optional): Leave this empty to use the default model
   - The default model for your selected provider is shown below the dropdown
   - Only change this if you want to use a specific model version

4. **Test Connection**: Click this button to verify your API key works
   - You'll see a success message if everything is configured correctly
   - If there's an error, double-check your API key

#### Integrations

This section adds extra capabilities to the AI assistant.

- **Tavily Search API Key** *(Recommended)*: Required for the AI to search the web. Without this, the assistant can only read URLs you paste directly. Free tier includes 1,000 searches/month.
- **JSearch API Key**: Enables the AI to search job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn for listings. Optional, but useful if you want the AI to find jobs for you.
- **Adzuna App ID & Key**: Alternative job board search (use either JSearch or Adzuna, not both)

### Saving Your Settings

1. Once you've entered at least your **Provider** and **API Key**, click **"Save Settings"** at the bottom
2. You'll see a "Settings saved successfully!" message
3. The app will automatically close the Settings panel and start the onboarding interview

### Onboarding Interview

After saving your settings, the AI Assistant chat panel will automatically open and interview you about your job search preferences.

**What to Expect:**

The AI will ask questions like:
- What types of roles are you looking for?
- What industries interest you?
- What skills do you have?
- What's your experience level?
- What are your salary expectations?
- Where are you located? Are you open to remote work?

**How to Respond:**

1. Type your answers in the chat box at the bottom
2. Be as detailed or brief as you like—the AI will adapt
3. You can skip questions by saying "skip" or "I'd rather not say"
4. The AI will use this information to help you find relevant jobs later

**Completing Onboarding:**

1. Answer the questions naturally—there are no wrong answers
2. When you've answered enough questions, the AI will thank you and save your profile
3. The onboarding is complete, and you can start using the app!

## Using the App

Now that you're set up, here's how to get started:

1. **Add your first job:** Click "Add Job" to manually track a position you're interested in
2. **Try the AI assistant:** Click "Chat" and ask it to find jobs for you — try something like "Find software engineer jobs in San Francisco" or "Scrape this job posting: [paste a URL]"
3. **Track your progress:** Update job statuses as you move through the pipeline (saved → applied → interviewing → offer/rejected)
4. **Manage your profile:** Click the Profile button to view or update your job preferences — the AI uses this to give you better recommendations
5. **Get help:** Click the "?" button in the header for built-in guides and tips

---

## Option B: Running from Source (Advanced)

If you prefer to run the application from source code (for development or customization), follow the steps below. This requires installing Python, Node.js, and other developer tools.

> **Note:** Most users should use [Option A: Desktop App](#option-a-desktop-app-recommended) instead. Running from source is intended for developers or users who want to modify the code.

### Prerequisites

You need to install three programs before you can run the Job Application Helper.

#### Install Python (3.12 or newer)

Python is the programming language that powers the backend of this application.

**Windows:**
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the **standalone installer** which is linked beneath the big yellow button. Avoid the big yellow button itself.
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. **Important:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install
5. Click "Install Now"

**Mac:**
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click the yellow "Download Python 3.12" button
3. Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation steps

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3-pip
```

**Verify Python is installed:**
Open a terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like "Python 3.12.x"

#### Install Node.js and npm

Node.js and npm are needed to run the web interface.

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Click the big green "Get Node.js" button
3. Click the green "Windows Installer" or "macOS Installer" depending on your OS
3. Run the installer and follow the default options
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

#### Install uv (Python Package Manager)

uv is a fast tool for managing Python dependencies.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installing, close and reopen your terminal, then verify:
```bash
uv --version
```

#### Install Git (Optional but Recommended)

Git helps you download and update the code easily.

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer with default settings

### Downloading the Code

#### Using Git (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to where you want to store the app. For example:
   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```
3. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper.git
   ```
4. Go into the new folder:
   ```bash
   cd job_app_helper
   ```

#### Download as ZIP (Alternative)

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper) in your web browser
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to a location you'll remember (like Documents)
5. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd Documents/job_app_helper-main
   ```

### Running the Application

We've made this easy! There's a single command that starts everything automatically.

**Windows:**
1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the job_app_helper folder:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\job_app_helper
   ```
3. Run the start script:
   ```bash
   start.bat
   ```

**Mac/Linux:**
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the job_app_helper folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/job_app_helper
   ```
3. Run the start script:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
   (If you get a "permission denied" error, run `chmod +x start.sh` first)

The script will:
- Check that Python, Node.js, and uv are installed
- Install any missing dependencies automatically
- Start both the backend and frontend servers
- Automatically open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal when you want to stop the app.

#### Manual Method

If you prefer to start the backend and frontend separately:

1. **Backend:** In one terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/job_app_helper
   uv run python main.py
   ```

2. **Frontend:** In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/job_app_helper/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Browser:** Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running Again Later

Just run the start script again — it handles everything automatically:

**Windows:**
```bash
cd path\to\job_app_helper
start.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd path/to/job_app_helper
./start.sh
```

After starting, continue to [Getting Your API Keys](#getting-your-api-keys) (first time) or [First-Time Setup](#first-time-setup) to configure the app.

## Troubleshooting

### Desktop App Issues

#### Windows SmartScreen warning

**Problem:** When installing, you see "Windows protected your PC."

**Solution:** Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"**. This warning appears because the app is not yet code-signed. It's safe to proceed.

#### macOS "unidentified developer" warning

**Problem:** macOS won't open the app, showing a security warning.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the message about the app
3. The app will open normally from now on

#### Linux AppImage won't run

**Problem:** The `.AppImage` file doesn't launch when double-clicked.

**Solution:** Make it executable first:
```bash
chmod +x job-app-helper_*.AppImage
./job-app-helper_*.AppImage
```

#### Desktop app shows blank screen

**Problem:** The app window opens but shows nothing.

**Solution:**
- Wait a few seconds — the backend may still be starting up
- Try closing and reopening the app
- Check if your antivirus/firewall is blocking the app
- If the issue persists, try [running from source](#option-b-running-from-source-advanced) instead

#### API key errors

**Problem:** You see "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed" errors.

**Solution:**
- Double-check that you copied the full API key (no extra spaces)
- Open Settings and use the "Test Connection" button to verify your configuration
- Verify your API key is still valid (check the provider's dashboard)
- Make sure you have credits/quota remaining with your AI provider
- If you just signed up, some providers take a few minutes to activate new API keys

### Run from Source Issues

#### "Command not found" errors

**Problem:** When you try to run `python`, `npm`, or `uv`, you get a "command not found" error.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you installed the software correctly (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
- Close and reopen your terminal after installing
- On Windows, make sure you checked "Add to PATH" during Python installation
- Try `python3` instead of `python` on Mac/Linux

#### Port already in use

**Problem:** You see an error like "Port 5000 is already in use" or "Port 3000 is already in use"

**Solution:**
- You might already have the app running in another terminal
- Close other terminals running the app
- On Windows, restart your computer
- On Mac/Linux, find and kill the process using that port:
  ```bash
  # For port 5000
  lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
  # For port 3000
  lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
  ```

#### Frontend shows blank page

**Problem:** The browser loads but shows nothing or shows an error.

**Solution:**
- Make sure both the backend AND frontend are running (you should have two terminal windows open)
- Check the backend terminal for errors
- Try refreshing the browser (press F5 or Cmd+R)
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser

#### Installation fails during `uv sync` or `npm install`

**Problem:** You get errors when installing dependencies.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- On Windows, try running the terminal as Administrator
- Delete the `.venv` folder (if it exists) and the `frontend/node_modules` folder, then try again
- Update uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (Mac/Linux) or reinstall from the website (Windows)

#### Windows: "Python was not found" but it's installed

**Problem:** Running `python --version` says "Python was not found" or opens the Microsoft Store.

**Solution:**
1. Open **Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases**
2. Turn **OFF** both `python.exe` and `python3.exe` aliases
3. Close and reopen your terminal
4. Run `start.bat` again

#### Windows: "uv is not recognized" after installation

**Problem:** The script says it installed `uv` but then says "uv is not recognized."

**Solution:** Restart your Command Prompt/PowerShell and run `start.bat` again. The script automatically uses `python -m uv` as a fallback.

### General Issues

#### AI responses are very slow

**Problem:** The AI takes a long time to respond.

**Solution:**
- This is normal for some providers, especially with free tiers
- Consider switching to a different provider
- If using Ollama, make sure you have enough RAM and a good CPU/GPU
- Check your internet connection

#### Settings panel doesn't open automatically

**Problem:** The Settings panel doesn't open when you first launch the app.

**Solution:**
- Click the "Settings" button (gear icon) in the top navigation bar to open it manually
- Try refreshing the browser page (if running from source)
- Check the browser console for errors (press F12, click "Console" tab)

#### Ollama connection failed

**Problem:** Can't connect to Ollama for local LLM.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Ollama is installed: [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)
2. Start the Ollama server: `ollama serve`
3. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1`
4. In Settings, select "Ollama (Local)" as your provider

> **Note:** Even with the desktop app, Ollama must be running as a separate process.

## Updating the App

### Desktop App

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper/releases)
2. Download the latest installer for your platform
3. Install it over the existing version — your data (jobs, profile, settings) is preserved because it's stored in a separate data directory

### Running from Source

```bash
cd path/to/job_app_helper

# Pull latest code
git pull

# Update backend dependencies
uv sync

# Update frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install
```

Then restart the app with `./start.sh` or `start.bat`.
