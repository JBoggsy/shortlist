# UI Redesign Report — Page-Based Architecture with Document Editor

> **Note:** This report was written before the UI redesign was implemented. The proposed page-based architecture with React Router was fully implemented in v0.11.1, including all pages described here (HomePage, JobTrackerPage, JobDetailPage, DocumentEditorPage, SettingsPage, ProfilePage, HelpPage) with NavigationBar, AppContext, and ChatPanel as the sole overlay. This report is retained for historical context on the design decisions.

## Executive Summary

The current Shortlist UI is a single-page application with one visible page (the job list) and five slide-out panels (Chat, Profile, Settings, Help, SearchResults). All state is managed in `App.jsx` via boolean flags (`chatOpen`, `profileOpen`, `settingsOpen`, `helpOpen`). There is no client-side router — no `react-router-dom` dependency exists.

This report proposes migrating to a **page-based architecture** with client-side routing, where the AI chat panel is the only persistent overlay. The document editor (Option C from the Resume & Cover Letter report) becomes a dedicated page with a side-by-side editor + chat layout.

## 1. Current UI Architecture

### 1.1 Layout Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header (sticky)                              │
│ [Add Job] [Help] [Settings] [Profile] [Chat] │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                              │
│   JobList (max-w-5xl, centered)              │
│   ├── Sort/filter controls                   │
│   ├── Job table rows                         │
│   └── JobDetailPanel (inline overlay)        │
│                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        Slide-out panels (right-anchored, z-50):
        ┌─────────────┐
        │ ChatPanel    │ ← resizable, has SearchResultsPanel companion
        │ ProfilePanel │ ← resizable
        │ SettingsPanel│ ← resizable
        │ HelpPanel    │ ← resizable
        └─────────────┘
```

### 1.2 Key Characteristics

- **No router**: App.jsx renders everything; panels toggle via boolean state
- **Panel-per-feature**: Each feature area (chat, profile, settings, help) is a slide-out panel with backdrop overlay, resize handle, close button
- **State explosion in App.jsx**: 11 `useState` calls just for panel/modal visibility and flow control (`chatOpen`, `profileOpen`, `settingsOpen`, `helpOpen`, `onboarding`, `onboardingChecked`, `pendingOnboarding`, `wizardOpen`, `jobsVersion`, `showAddForm`, `updateInfo`)
- **Shared pattern**: Every panel uses `useResizablePanel` hook, has a backdrop div, identical header/close layout
- **Panel conflicts**: Multiple panels can open simultaneously but compete for screen space; no coordination between them
- **Single content area**: The only "page" is the job list. Everything else is an overlay.
- **JobDetailPanel** is rendered inline within JobList (not a slide-out), appearing as an overlay within the main content area

### 1.3 Problems with Current Design

1. **Cluttered header**: 5 buttons in the nav bar, each opening a different panel
2. **Panel stacking**: Opening Chat + SearchResults + clicking a job detail = overlapping panels with no clear hierarchy
3. **No deep linking**: Can't link to a specific settings section, help topic, or job detail
4. **Poor extensibility**: Every new feature = new boolean in App.jsx + new panel component + new header button
5. **App.jsx is a god component**: Orchestrates all panels, onboarding flow, health checks, update banner, error handling, and job state
6. **Mobile unfriendly**: Slide-out panels don't work well on narrow screens; multiple panels are unusable

---

## 2. Proposed Architecture

### 2.1 Page Structure

```
/                       → Home (dashboard)
/jobs                   → Job Tracker (current JobList, full-featured)
/jobs/:id               → Job Detail (expanded view, replaces JobDetailPanel overlay)
/jobs/:id/documents/:type → Document Editor (side-by-side editor + chat)
/settings               → Settings (full page, replaces SettingsPanel)
/profile                → Profile (full page, replaces ProfilePanel)
/help                   → Help (full page, replaces HelpPanel)
```

        └──────────────┘
```

### 2.3 Component Hierarchy

```
App.jsx
├── NavigationBar          (sticky top bar with route links + chat toggle)
├── UpdateBanner           (Tauri only, conditional)
├── ToastContainer         (global notifications)
├── SetupWizard            (first-run modal, conditional)
├── <Routes>
│   ├── / → HomePage

    └── SearchResultsPanel (companion panel, conditional)
```

### 2.4 Navigation Bar

The header transitions from action buttons to a proper navigation bar:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 Shortlist    Jobs   Profile   Settings   Help    [💬 AI] │
│                  ▔▔▔▔                                       │
│             (active indicator under current page)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Left**: App logo/name (links to home)
- **Center**: Page links with active state indicator (underline or highlight)
- **Right**: Chat toggle button (the only button that opens a panel overlay)
- The "Add Job" button moves into the JobTrackerPage itself (contextual action, not global)
- On narrow screens, the nav collapses to a hamburger menu

---

## 3. Document Editor Page (Option C)

### 3.1 Layout

The document editor page is the centerpiece of this redesign. It implements the "real-time side-by-side editing" from Option C of the Resume & Cover Letter report.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Nav Bar                                              [💬] │

│ Editor Toolbar                                           │
│ [← Back to Job] [Save ✓] [Undo] [Redo] [v3 ▼] [Export] │
├────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┤
│                            │                             │
│   Text Editor              │   Chat Panel                │
│   (rich text editing)      │   (contextual to document)  │
│                            │                             │

│                            │                             │
├────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┤
│ Status: Cover Letter for Acme Corp – SWE │ v3 │ Saved    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Key Features

**Text Editor (left pane)**
- Rich text editing powered by a library like **Tiptap** (ProseMirror-based, React-native, extensible, MIT licensed) or **Plate** (also ProseMirror, more opinionated toward Tailwind)
- Standard editing features: bold, italic, bullet lists, headings, undo/redo
- Auto-save with debounce (creates new version after idle period + manual save button)
- Clean document-like appearance (generous margins, readable font, proper heading hierarchy)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S save, Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+Shift+Z redo

**Chat Panel (right pane)**
- The global ChatPanel is reused but scoped to the current document context
- When on the document editor page, the chat panel docks into the right pane instead of floating as a slide-out overlay
- The agent is automatically aware of the document being edited (the document content is included in context via `get_job_document`)
- Agent edits to the document automatically refresh the editor (via `document_saved` SSE event)
- Agent can highlight the specific section it changed (stretch goal)

**Version History**
- Dropdown in the toolbar showing all versions with timestamps and edit summaries
- Click a version to view it (read-only)
- "Restore" button to promote an old version as the new latest
- Diff view between any two versions (using a lightweight diff library)

**Export**
- Copy to clipboard (plain text)
- Download as `.txt` or `.md`
- Future: PDF/DOCX export via backend endpoint

### 3.3 Editor ↔ Agent Interaction Flow

```
User opens /jobs/42/documents/cover_letter
  │
  ├─ Editor loads latest version from GET /api/jobs/42/documents?type=cover_letter
  ├─ Chat panel opens in document-aware mode
  │
  ├─ User edits directly in the editor
  │   └─ On save: POST /api/jobs/42/documents (content, editSummary="Manual edit")
  │       └─ New version created, toolbar version indicator updates
  │
  ├─ User types in chat: "Make the tone more confident"
  │   └─ Agent calls get_job_document → reads latest version
  │   └─ Agent produces new content
  │   └─ Agent calls save_job_document → new version saved
  │   └─ Backend emits document_saved SSE event
  │   └─ Editor receives event → reloads content → user sees changes
  │   └─ Chat shows summary: "Updated cover letter (v4). Made tone more assertive."
  │
  └─ User can undo agent changes by restoring previous version
```

### 3.4 Rich Text Editor Evaluation

| Library | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| **Tiptap** (v2) | ProseMirror-based, excellent React support, highly extensible, great docs, MIT core | Pro extensions paid (but not needed for our use case) | **Recommended** |
| **Plate** | ProseMirror-based, Tailwind-first, headless UI components | Newer, smaller community | Good alternative |
| **Lexical** (Meta) | Fast, accessible, React-native | Steeper learning curve, less mature ecosystem | Overengineered for this use case |
| **Milkdown** | Markdown-first, plugin system | Smaller community, fewer resources | Decent if markdown-only is acceptable |
| Plain `<textarea>` | Zero dependencies, simple | No formatting, poor UX for documents | Only for v0/prototype |

**Recommendation: Tiptap v2.** It's the most mature ProseMirror wrapper for React, has excellent Tailwind integration, and the free tier includes everything we need (bold, italic, lists, headings, undo/redo, placeholder text). The `@tiptap/starter-kit` package covers all standard formatting. It also supports collaborative editing extensions if we ever want real-time co-editing.

---

## 4. Migration Strategy

### 4.1 New Dependencies

```
npm install react-router-dom @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit @tiptap/extension-placeholder
```

### 4.2 Phased Implementation

#### Phase 1: Router Foundation & Page Shells

**Goal:** Introduce React Router, create page shell components, move existing panel content into pages. Chat remains the only panel.

**Changes:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | Add `react-router-dom` |
| `main.jsx` | Wrap `<App>` in `<BrowserRouter>` |
| `App.jsx` | Replace panel state management with `<Routes>` + `<Outlet>`. Keep ChatPanel as overlay. Remove `settingsOpen`, `profileOpen`, `helpOpen` state. |
| `NavigationBar.jsx` | **New.** `<NavLink>` components for each route, chat toggle button |
| `pages/HomePage.jsx` | **New.** Dashboard with quick stats, recent jobs, recent documents |
| `pages/JobTrackerPage.jsx` | **New.** Wraps existing `JobList` content. "Add Job" button moves here. |
| `pages/JobDetailPage.jsx` | **New.** Wraps existing `JobDetailPanel` content as a full page. Uses `useParams()` for job ID. |
| `pages/SettingsPage.jsx` | **New.** Moves `SettingsPanel` content into a full page layout (no slide-out wrapper, no backdrop, no resize handle). |
| `pages/ProfilePage.jsx` | **New.** Moves `ProfilePanel` content into a full page layout. |
| `pages/HelpPage.jsx` | **New.** Moves `HelpPanel` content into a full page layout. |

**App.jsx after Phase 1 (simplified):**
```jsx
function App() {
  const [chatOpen, setChatOpen] = useState(false);
  const [onboarding, setOnboarding] = useState(false);
  // ... onboarding/wizard state (minimal)

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      <NavigationBar onChatToggle={() => setChatOpen(!chatOpen)} chatOpen={chatOpen} />
      <main className="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        <Outlet />
      </main>
      <ChatPanel isOpen={chatOpen} onClose={() => setChatOpen(false)} ... />
      <SetupWizard ... />
      <ToastContainer ... />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Migration approach for panels → pages:** Extract the inner content of each panel (everything inside the slide-out wrapper) into a standalone component. The page component just renders this content in a normal page layout. The old panel component can be deleted. This is mostly a cut-and-paste with removal of the panel chrome (backdrop, resize handle, close button, fixed positioning).

#### Phase 2: Document Editor Page

**Goal:** Build the document editor with side-by-side chat. Wire up the backend SSE events.

**Changes:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | Add `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, `@tiptap/extension-placeholder` |
| `pages/DocumentEditorPage.jsx` | **New.** Main editor page with toolbar, Tiptap editor, docked chat. Uses `useParams()` for job ID and doc type. |
| `components/DocumentEditor.jsx` | **New.** Tiptap editor wrapper component with formatting toolbar. |
| `components/EditorToolbar.jsx` | **New.** Save, undo, redo, version selector, export buttons. |
| `components/VersionHistory.jsx` | **New.** Dropdown/sidebar showing document versions. |
| `api.js` | Add `fetchJobDocument`, `fetchDocumentHistory`, `saveJobDocument`, `deleteJobDocument` |
| `backend/models/job.py` | Add `has_cover_letter`/`has_resume` to `to_dict()` |
| `backend/routes/jobs.py` | Query document presence for job list |
| `backend/agent/tools/job_documents.py` | Add `document_saved` SSE event emission |
| `ChatPanel.jsx` | Handle `document_saved` SSE event; support "docked mode" for document editor page |
| `pages/JobDetailPage.jsx` | Add documents section with links to `/jobs/:id/documents/:type` |
| `pages/JobTrackerPage.jsx` | Add document indicator icons to job rows |

#### Phase 3: Polish & Enhanced Features

**Goal:** Diff view, export, version restore, improved document formatting, responsive design.

**Changes:**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Diff view | Add a lightweight diff library (e.g., `diff` npm package). Compare any two versions in a split view. |
| Export | Backend endpoint using `python-docx` or `weasyprint` for PDF/DOCX generation. Frontend download button. |
| Version restore | "Restore this version" button that creates a new version with the old content. |
| Responsive design | Stacked layout on narrow screens (editor above, chat below). Collapsible nav. |
| Document templates | Pre-loaded cover letter/resume templates selectable when creating a new document. |

### 4.3 Tauri Compatibility

React Router uses client-side routing with the History API. Tauri's webview supports this natively — no special configuration needed. However, the Vite config needs a `historyApiFallback` equivalent:

```js
// vite.config.js — add to dev server config
server: {
  historyApiFallback: true // Vite calls this via the default SPA behavior
}
```

For production builds, Tauri loads `index.html` locally, which already works with client-side routing since all routes are handled by React Router (no server-side routing needed).

---

## 5. State Management Considerations

### 5.1 Current State (All in App.jsx)

The current App.jsx manages 11+ state variables. With routing, most panel visibility state disappears entirely — the URL becomes the source of truth for which "page" is shown.

### 5.2 Proposed State Distribution

| State | Location | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Chat open/closed | App.jsx (persists across pages) | Chat is the only global overlay |
| Onboarding flow | App.jsx (persists across pages) | Global flow, not page-specific |
| Jobs data | JobTrackerPage (local) | Only needed on that page; `jobsVersion` counter for refresh |
| Job detail | JobDetailPage (local, from `useParams`) | Route param drives data fetch |
| Document content | DocumentEditorPage (local) | Editor state is page-scoped |
| Settings config | SettingsPage (local) | Fetch on mount, save on submit |
| Profile content | ProfilePage (local) | Fetch on mount, save on submit |
| Toast notifications | App.jsx (global) | Cross-page notifications |

### 5.3 Cross-Page Communication

Two features require cross-page communication:

1. **Agent creates/edits a job → job list should refresh when user navigates back.** Solution: The ChatPanel (global) can maintain a `dirtyJobs` flag. When the user navigates to the job tracker, it checks this flag and refreshes if needed. Alternatively, always re-fetch on mount (simplest).

2. **Agent saves a document → document editor should refresh.** Solution: The ChatPanel processes `document_saved` SSE events. When on the document editor page, the ChatPanel calls a callback (provided via React context or prop) to notify the editor. When not on the editor page, the event is noted but no action is needed.

**Recommended approach:** Use a lightweight **React Context** (`AppContext`) to hold a small set of cross-cutting state:
```jsx
const AppContext = createContext();

// Provides:
// - chatOpen / setChatOpen
// - onboarding state
// - addToast
// - jobsVersion / bumpJobsVersion (for cross-page refresh)
// - documentRefreshSignal (for agent → editor communication)
```

This replaces the prop-drilling currently done through App.jsx and keeps the context lean (no full state management library needed).

---

## 6. Extensibility

The page-based architecture makes the app trivially extensible:

### Adding a New Feature/Page

1. Create `pages/NewFeaturePage.jsx`
2. Add a route in `App.jsx`: `<Route path="/new-feature" element={<NewFeaturePage />} />`
3. Add a nav link in `NavigationBar.jsx`
4. Done. No new state in App.jsx. No new panel component. No new boolean flag.

### Adding a New Sub-Page

1. Create `pages/SubPage.jsx`
2. Add a nested route under the parent
3. The parent page renders `<Outlet />` for child routes

### Examples of Future Features That Fit Naturally

| Feature | Route | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Interview Prep | `/jobs/:id/interview-prep` | Sub-page of job detail |
| Analytics/Dashboard | `/analytics` | New top-level page |
| Templates Library | `/templates` | New top-level page |
| Networking/Contacts | `/contacts` | New top-level page |
| Calendar/Timeline | `/calendar` | New top-level page |

Each is just a new page component + route + nav link. The chat panel works with all of them automatically since it's a global overlay.

---

## 7. File Change Summary

### New Dependencies
| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `react-router-dom` | Client-side routing |
| `@tiptap/react` | Rich text editor React bindings |
| `@tiptap/starter-kit` | Standard editor extensions (bold, italic, lists, headings, etc.) |
| `@tiptap/extension-placeholder` | Placeholder text in empty editor |

### New Files (Phase 1 + 2)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/src/components/NavigationBar.jsx` | App navigation with route links and chat toggle |
| `frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.jsx` | Shared state context (chat, toasts, refresh signals) |
| `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` | Dashboard with recent jobs, documents, quick settings |
| `frontend/src/pages/JobTrackerPage.jsx` | Full job list with filters, sort, add button |
| `frontend/src/pages/JobDetailPage.jsx` | Full job detail with todos, documents section |
| `frontend/src/pages/DocumentEditorPage.jsx` | Side-by-side editor + chat |
| `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.jsx` | Full-page settings |
| `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx` | Full-page profile + resume |
| `frontend/src/pages/HelpPage.jsx` | Full-page help |
| `frontend/src/components/DocumentEditor.jsx` | Tiptap editor wrapper |
| `frontend/src/components/EditorToolbar.jsx` | Editor toolbar controls |
| `frontend/src/components/VersionHistory.jsx` | Document version history |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/package.json` | Add dependencies |
| `frontend/src/main.jsx` | Wrap in `<BrowserRouter>` |
| `frontend/src/App.jsx` | Major rewrite: remove panel state, add `<Routes>`, keep ChatPanel as only overlay |
| `frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.jsx` | Add "docked mode" for document editor, handle `document_saved` events, add `save_job_document` to `JOB_MUTATING_TOOLS` |
| `frontend/src/api.js` | Add 4 document API functions |
| `frontend/vite.config.js` | Ensure SPA fallback for dev and build |
| `backend/models/job.py` | Add `has_cover_letter`/`has_resume` to `to_dict()` |
| `backend/routes/jobs.py` | Query document presence for job list |
| `backend/agent/tools/job_documents.py` | Emit `document_saved` SSE event |

### Deleted Files (after migration complete)

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx` | Content moved to `SettingsPage.jsx` |
| `frontend/src/components/ProfilePanel.jsx` | Content moved to `ProfilePage.jsx` |
| `frontend/src/components/HelpPanel.jsx` | Content moved to `HelpPage.jsx` |
| `frontend/src/components/JobDetailPanel.jsx` | Content moved to `JobDetailPage.jsx` |

Note: These can be deleted once the pages are fully functional and tested. The inner content is reused — only the slide-out panel wrapper (backdrop, resize handle, fixed positioning) is removed.

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

### 8.1 Large Migration Surface

**Risk:** Touching App.jsx, all panels, and adding routing affects every part of the frontend.

**Mitigation:** Phase 1 can be done incrementally. Start by adding the router and creating page shells that literally just render the existing panel content (minus the slide-out wrapper). Each panel → page migration can be its own commit. The old panels can coexist with the new pages during transition.

### 8.2 Chat Panel Complexity

**Risk:** ChatPanel is the most complex component (~500+ lines). Making it work in both "overlay mode" (normal pages) and "docked mode" (document editor) adds complexity.

**Mitigation:** Extract the chat core (conversation list, message rendering, input, SSE handling) into a `ChatCore` component. Then `ChatPanel` (overlay) and the document editor page each render `ChatCore` with different layout wrappers. This also makes ChatPanel more maintainable independently.

### 8.3 Onboarding Flow

**Risk:** The onboarding flow (health check → wizard → onboarding chat) currently relies heavily on App.jsx state coordination. Routing could break this.

**Mitigation:** Keep onboarding logic in App.jsx / AppContext. The onboarding flow happens early (before the user navigates anywhere) and only involves the wizard modal + chat panel — neither of which are page-routed. No change needed to the onboarding flow itself.

### 8.4 Tauri Deep Linking

**Risk:** Tauri loads from a local file, not a web server. Deep links (e.g., refreshing on `/jobs/42`) need to resolve correctly.

**Mitigation:** Tauri serves the built `index.html` for all paths by default (single-page app behavior). Use `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` if issues arise — hash routing (`/#/jobs/42`) works universally without server configuration. However, `BrowserRouter` should work fine with Tauri's default setup since there's no server-side routing involved.

### 8.5 Editor Library Bundle Size

**Risk:** Tiptap adds to the frontend bundle.

**Mitigation:** Tiptap core + starter-kit is ~150KB gzipped. This is reasonable for a desktop app. The document editor page can also be lazy-loaded (`React.lazy()`) so the editor code is only fetched when the user navigates to it.

| App.jsx state | 11+ useState for panels/flow | ~4 useState (chat, onboarding, toasts, wizard) |
| Adding a new feature | New boolean + panel + button | New page file + route + nav link |
| Document editing | Doesn't exist | Dedicated page with Tiptap + docked chat |
| Chat panel | Slide-out overlay | Slide-out overlay (unchanged) OR docked in editor |
| Panel count | 5 slide-out panels | 1 slide-out panel (chat only) |
| Deep linking | Not possible | Full URL-based navigation |
