## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — builds Tauri desktop app for Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64, and Windows x86_64 on `v*` tag push; creates draft GitHub Release with installer artifacts
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — builds Linux + Windows on PRs to `main` to verify the app compiles
- Windows sidecar build script (`build_sidecar.ps1`) — PowerShell equivalent of `build_sidecar.sh` for building Flask backend as standalone binary on Windows

### Changed

**Documentation Restructure for Desktop Distribution**
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` restructured into two-track layout: "Desktop App (Recommended)" for regular users and "Running from Source (Advanced)" for developers
- `README.md` hero section restructured with prominent Download section and platform table; "Run from Source" demoted to brief subsection
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` updated with CI/CD Pipeline section covering workflows, build scripts, and release process
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` updated with desktop app notes in bug reports and PR checklist
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` updated with installation method and app version fields
- `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect desktop app as primary distribution method
- `docs/TODO.md` updated with completed Phase 2 items and version annotations

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

**Tauri v2 Desktop App (Optional)**
- Added Tauri v2 as an optional native desktop wrapper using the sidecar approach
- Tauri renders the React frontend in a native webview and launches Flask as a child process
- Data files (app.db, config.json, logs/, user_profile.md) are stored in platform-standard directories when running under Tauri
- Existing browser-based workflow (`start.sh` / `start.bat`) preserved as fallback

**Data Directory Abstraction**
- New `backend/data_dir.py` module with `get_data_dir()` for centralized data directory resolution
- `DATA_DIR` environment variable support to override data file location
- `main.py` now accepts `--data-dir` and `--port` CLI arguments
- All data file paths (database, config, logs, user profile) now resolve through `get_data_dir()`

**Frontend Tauri Compatibility**
- Added `getApiBase()` in `frontend/src/api.js` for absolute URL resolution in Tauri webview (detects Tauri via `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`)
- Tauri-compatible Vite config settings (`clearScreen`, `envPrefix`, `strictPort`)

**Build & Tooling**
- `build_sidecar.sh` script for bundling Flask backend as a standalone binary via PyInstaller with Tauri target-triple naming
- Tauri project scaffolding (`src-tauri/`) with Rust sidecar launch logic, capabilities, and configuration
- `npm run tauri:dev` and `npm run tauri:build` scripts in `frontend/package.json`
- PyInstaller added as a dev dependency

**Agent Improvements**
- Increased agent `MAX_ITERATIONS` from 10 to 25 for handling complex multi-step tasks

### Changed

**Project Cleanup**
- Moved developer/contributor documentation into `docs/` directory (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, DEVELOPMENT, INSTALLATION, TODO, config.example.json)
- Updated all cross-references in README.md and other docs to reflect new locations
- README.md and CLAUDE.md remain at project root per GitHub/Claude Code conventions

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

**In-App Help Panel**
- New Help panel accessible via the `?` button in the header
- Getting Started section with a 3-step guide (configure LLM → onboarding → add jobs)
- Job Tracking section covering statuses, fields, and how to add/edit/delete jobs
- AI Chat Assistant section with example prompts and tool descriptions
- Getting API Keys section with direct links for all supported providers and integrations (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Tavily, JSearch, Adzuna)
- Troubleshooting section with solutions for the most common issues

**Onboarding Agent Configuration UI**
- New collapsible "Onboarding Agent" section in the Settings panel
- Allows configuring a separate (cheaper) LLM provider, API key, and model for the one-time onboarding interview
- Defaults to the main AI Assistant configuration when left blank
- Backend support for `onboarding_llm.*` configuration was already present; this adds the missing UI

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

**Windows Compatibility - uv PATH Issue**
- Fixed `uv` command not being recognized after installation on Windows
- `start.bat` now automatically uses `python -m uv` as fallback when `uv` command is not in PATH
- Added `UV_CMD` variable used consistently throughout the script
- Script notifies users they can use `uv` directly after restarting terminal
- Added troubleshooting section to README for uv PATH issues

This fix resolves the issue where `uv` installs successfully via `pip install uv` but the command is not recognized until the terminal is restarted, due to Windows PATH caching.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

**Windows Compatibility**
- Fixed Python detection on Windows when Microsoft Store app execution aliases are enabled
- `start.bat` now automatically tries `python3` command as fallback when `python` is intercepted by Windows Store
- Added clear error messages guiding Windows users to disable app execution aliases
- Added troubleshooting section to README specifically for Windows Python detection issues

This fix resolves the common issue where `python --version` fails on Windows even when Python is installed, due to Windows Store aliases intercepting the command.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

- Removed deprecated `.env` file references
- Added configuration priority documentation (defaults → config.json → env vars)

### Changed

- README.md restructured to prioritize user experience over technical details
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with Quick Start section for new contributors
