## Polish & Publication

- [x] **Polish repository for GitHub publication**

  - Add LICENSE file (choose appropriate open source license)
  - Add CHANGELOG.md to track version history and notable changes

  - Build infrastructure for Windows/Mac standalone builds (consider PyInstaller/Electron or Tauri)
  - Create release workflow for downloadable executables
  - Document installation process clearly in README

- [ ] **In-app help and documentation**
  - Add Help section in app UI (help icon/button in header)
  - Create interactive tutorial/walkthrough for first-time users
  - Build feature wiki or help docs within app (how to use chat, job tracking, etc.)

    - How to get API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama)
    - How to set environment variables or configure API keys
    - How to select and configure different models
    - Troubleshooting common setup issues

- [ ] **In-app LLM provider and model selection**
  - Add settings panel in UI for selecting LLM provider and model
