## 🚨 Urgent Bugfixes

- [x] **CRITICAL: First-time user onboarding deadlock** (FIXED)
  - **Problem**: When the app starts for the first time, it automatically triggers onboarding, but the LLM settings haven't been configured yet. This causes:
    1. Onboarding chat remains empty (no initial message appears because LLM request fails)
    2. Onboarding chat is uncloseable, blocking access to the Settings panel
    3. User cannot configure LLM settings because the onboarding modal blocks the UI
    4. This creates a deadlock: can't configure settings without closing onboarding, can't complete onboarding without configuring settings
  - **Impact**: App is completely unusable for first-time users following the Quick Start guide
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - App now checks `/api/health` endpoint on first launch to verify LLM is configured
    - If LLM not configured and user needs onboarding, Settings panel opens automatically instead of onboarding
    - After user saves LLM configuration, onboarding automatically starts
    - This ensures proper setup flow: Settings → Onboarding → App usage

## Features

- [ ] **Improve agent orchestration**
  - Provide more guidance to the agent using an architected workflow rather than relying on the
    agent to just work
  - Create sub-agents for particular common tasks such as job searching, job evaluation, and job
    adding

- [ ] **Job application preparation**
  - Add per-job preparation components (interview prep, resume tailoring, cover letter drafts)
  - Store preparation notes/materials linked to each job
  - Agent tools to generate and manage prep content

- [ ] **Resume uploading and parsing**
  - Add ability for user to upload resume, which will be parsed and used to inform job search
