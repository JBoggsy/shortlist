## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

**Windows Compatibility - uv PATH Issue**
- Fixed `uv` command not being recognized after installation on Windows
- `start.bat` now automatically uses `python -m uv` as fallback when `uv` command is not in PATH
- Added `UV_CMD` variable used consistently throughout the script
- Script notifies users they can use `uv` directly after restarting terminal
- Added troubleshooting section to README for uv PATH issues

This fix resolves the issue where `uv` installs successfully via `pip install uv` but the command is not recognized until the terminal is restarted, due to Windows PATH caching.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

**Windows Compatibility**
- Fixed Python detection on Windows when Microsoft Store app execution aliases are enabled
- `start.bat` now automatically tries `python3` command as fallback when `python` is intercepted by Windows Store
- Added clear error messages guiding Windows users to disable app execution aliases
- Added troubleshooting section to README specifically for Windows Python detection issues

This fix resolves the common issue where `python --version` fails on Windows even when Python is installed, due to Windows Store aliases intercepting the command.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

**Simplified Installation & Startup**

- Automatic dependency checking with friendly installation guidance
- Auto-install of missing dependencies where possible
- Concurrent backend and frontend server startup
- Automatic browser opening to application URL
- Graceful shutdown handling with Ctrl+C

**Configuration System**
- File-based configuration system using `config.json`
- Configuration management API (`backend/config_manager.py`)
- REST API endpoints for reading and updating configuration (`/api/config`)
- LLM connection testing endpoint (`/api/config/test`)
- Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- Configuration template file (`config.example.json`)
- Environment variables now override file-based config (backwards compatible)

**Settings UI**
- New Settings panel in the application UI (gear icon in header)
- Visual LLM provider selection (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama)
- API key management with masked input fields
- Real-time connection testing with "Test Connection" button
- Integration settings (Tavily Search, JSearch, Adzuna)

- Clear success/error messages for user actions

**Error Handling & UX**
- Graceful error messages when LLM is not configured

- Better error messages for LLM provider initialization failures
- Health check endpoint showing configuration status
- Improved dependency version checking in startup scripts

**Documentation**
- Completely restructured README.md with "Easy Setup" section
- Settings UI documented as primary configuration method
- New Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- Updated DEVELOPMENT.md with config.json system details
- Removed deprecated `.env` file references
- Added configuration priority documentation (defaults → config.json → env vars)
- Updated API reference with Config API endpoints

### Changed
- Configuration system now uses `config.json` as primary method (environment variables still supported)
- Removed `example.env` in favor of `config.example.json`
- README.md restructured to prioritize user experience over technical details
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with Quick Start section for new contributors
- Startup workflow simplified from multi-terminal process to single command

### Deprecated
- Direct `.env` file usage (environment variables still work but config.json is recommended for local development)
