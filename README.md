> A desktop application and web app to track and manage job applications with an AI-powered assistant

Job Application Helper helps you organize your job search. Track applications through the hiring pipeline, store job details, and leverage an AI assistant that can search the web, scrape job postings, and automatically add jobs to your tracker—all through a simple chat interface. Available as a downloadable desktop app or as a web app you can run from source.

## Features

- **Job Tracking Dashboard**: Manage all your job applications in one place with sortable columns and status badges
- **AI-Powered Assistant**: Chat with an AI that can research jobs, scrape URLs, search job boards, and add jobs automatically
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Choose from Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or run locally with Ollama
- **Web Search Integration**: Built-in web search (via Tavily) for finding job postings and company information
- **Job Board Integration**: Search Adzuna and JSearch job boards directly from the chat
- **User Profile System**: Personalized onboarding interview to understand your job preferences and goals
- **Resume Upload**: Upload your resume (PDF or DOCX) so the AI assistant can reference it for job fit evaluation and recommendations. An AI agent automatically cleans up PDF extraction artifacts and structures your resume into a rich, browsable format.
- **Rich Job Details**: Track salary ranges, location, remote type, requirements, contact info, and more
- **Job Fit Ratings**: Rate how well each job matches your profile (0-5 stars)
- **Guided Setup Wizard**: First-time setup walks you through choosing a provider and entering your API key, with inline step-by-step instructions for each key
- **Desktop App**: Download and install—no programming tools required. Also runs as a web app from source.

## Configuration

### Using the Settings UI (Recommended)

The easiest way to configure the AI assistant is through the Settings panel:

1. **Open the app** in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click the Settings icon** (gear icon) in the top-right header
3. **Choose your LLM provider** from the dropdown (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or Ollama)
4. **Enter your API key** (if required - Ollama runs locally and doesn't need one)
5. **Click "Test Connection"** to verify your credentials work
6. **Click "Save Settings"** to persist your configuration

**Optional integrations** (enables additional features):
- **Tavily Search API (Recommended)**: Enables web search tool
- **JSearch API** (RapidAPI): Enables job board search (recommended)
- **Adzuna API**: Alternative job board search

> See the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on obtaining API keys.

All settings are saved to a local `config.json` file and persist across restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Desktop App Issues

**Windows SmartScreen warning**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway" (the app is not yet code-signed).

**macOS "unidentified developer"**: Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Click "Open Anyway".

**Blank screen on launch**: Wait a few seconds for the backend to start. If it persists, try restarting the app.

### General Issues

**"LLM is not configured"**: Click the Settings gear icon, select an LLM provider, enter your API key, and click Save Settings.

**Ollama connection failed**: Make sure Ollama is running separately (`ollama serve`) with a model pulled (`ollama pull llama3.1`).

### Run from Source Issues

**Dependencies not installed**: Install [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/), and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

**Windows "Python was not found"**: Disable app execution aliases in Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases.

**Port already in use**: Stop other processes using ports 3000/5000, or restart your computer.

**Missing dependencies after git pull**: Run `uv sync` and `cd frontend && npm install`.
