## Quick Start

See [the Installation guide](INSTALLATION.md) for an easy-to-follow guide to installing and running
the Job App Helper.

### Easy Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with our one-command startup script:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper.git
cd job_app_helper
```

2. **Run the startup script**:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
start.bat

## Troubleshooting

### "LLM is not configured" error

**Problem**: The AI assistant shows "LLM is not configured" when you try to use it.

**Solution**:
1. Click the **Settings** (gear icon) in the header
2. Select an LLM provider and enter your API key
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify it works
4. Click **Save Settings**

### Dependencies not installed

**Problem**: The startup script says Python, Node.js, or uv is not installed.

**Solution**:
- **Python**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (need 3.12+)
- **Node.js**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (need 18+)
- **uv**: Run `pip install uv` or see [installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Windows: "Python was not found" but it's installed

**Problem** (Windows only): Running `python --version` says "Python was not found" or opens the Microsoft Store, even though Python is installed.

**Cause**: Windows has app execution aliases that intercept the `python` command and redirect it to the Microsoft Store.

**Solution**:
1. Open **Settings** → **Apps** → **Advanced app settings** → **App execution aliases**
2. Turn **OFF** both `python.exe` and `python3.exe` aliases
3. Close and reopen your Command Prompt/PowerShell
4. Run `start.bat` again

**Alternative**: The updated `start.bat` script now automatically tries `python3` as a fallback, which may work even if `python` doesn't.

### Windows: "uv is not recognized" after installation

**Problem** (Windows only): The script says it installed `uv` but then says "uv is not recognized as an internal or external command."

**Cause**: When `pip` installs `uv`, the executable goes to Python's Scripts directory, which may not be in your PATH for the current terminal session.

**Solution**:
1. **Restart your Command Prompt/PowerShell** - This is the simplest fix
2. Run `start.bat` again - it should now work

**Alternative**: The updated `start.bat` script automatically uses `python -m uv` as a fallback if the `uv` command isn't available, so the script should work even without restarting.

### Port already in use

**Problem**: "Address already in use" error on port 3000 or 5000.

**Solution**:
- Stop any other processes using those ports
- Or change the ports in `vite.config.js` (frontend) and `main.py` (backend)

### Ollama connection failed

**Problem**: Can't connect to Ollama for local LLM.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Ollama is installed: [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)
2. Start the Ollama server: `ollama serve`
3. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1`
4. In Settings, select "Ollama (Local)" as your provider

### AI assistant not responding

**Problem**: Messages sent to the AI don't get responses.

**Solution**:
1. Check the browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check the backend terminal for error messages
3. Verify your API key is correct in Settings
4. Try the "Test Connection" button in Settings
5. Check your internet connection (for cloud providers)

### Missing dependencies after git pull

**Problem**: App won't start after pulling latest changes.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall backend dependencies
uv sync

# Reinstall frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install
```

- Report bugs at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JBoggsy/job_app_helper/issues)
- See logs in `logs/app.log` for backend errors

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2 (optional native wrapper, sidecar architecture)
- **AI Providers**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama
- **Package Managers**: uv (Python), npm (JavaScript)

## Desktop App (Optional)

The app can also run as a native desktop application using [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). Tauri wraps the React frontend in a native webview and launches the Flask backend as a sidecar process. Data files are stored in platform-standard directories (e.g., `~/.local/share/com.jobapphelper.app` on Linux).

```bash
# Development: start Flask manually, then launch Tauri
uv run python main.py                  # Terminal 1
npm run tauri:dev                      # Terminal 2

# Production build (requires Rust toolchain)
./build_sidecar.sh                     # Bundle Flask as standalone binary
npm run tauri:build                    # Build the desktop app
```

The browser-based workflow (`./start.sh` / `start.bat`) continues to work as before. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for more details.
