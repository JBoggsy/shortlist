"""Interview Prep workflow — generate tailored interview preparation.

Pipeline:
1. A ``JobResolver`` identifies which tracked job to prepare for.
2. The user's resume, profile, and the job's details are loaded.
3. A planning step analyses the job posting, the user's profile, and
   their resume to identify the key themes, likely focus areas, and
   notable gaps that the downstream sub-modules should address.
4. Five specialist sub-modules run **in parallel**, each generating one
   category of interview preparation material:

   a. **Company & Role Research Brief** — key facts about the company
      (mission, culture, recent news/developments, competitive
      landscape) and how the role fits into the organisation.  Gives
      the candidate concrete talking points that demonstrate research.
   b. **Behavioural Questions & STAR Answers** — likely behavioural /
      competency-based questions derived from the job's stated values,
      responsibilities, and team context, paired with STAR-format
      answer frameworks drawn from the candidate's *actual* experience
      in their resume and profile.
   c. **Technical & Domain Questions** — technical or domain-specific
      questions inferred from the job requirements, tech stack, and
      role level.  Each question includes preparation notes: key
      concepts to review, relevant projects from the candidate's
      background, and suggested talking points.
   d. **Weakness & Gap Mitigation** — honest assessment of areas where
      the candidate's profile does not fully match the stated
      requirements, with concrete strategies for addressing each gap
      confidently (transferable skills, learning trajectory, adjacent
      experience, etc.).
   e. **Questions for the Interviewer** — thoughtful, role-aware
      questions the candidate should consider asking, organised by
      audience (hiring manager, peer, skip-level).  Each question
      includes a brief note on *why* it's valuable to ask and what
      signal to look for in the answer.

5. An assembly step merges the five outputs into a single, well-
   organised prep guide, resolves any cross-section redundancy, and
   adds a concise "day-of" checklist at the top.
