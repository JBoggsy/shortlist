"""Job Search workflow — search job boards and return a curated list.

Pipeline:
1. A DSPy module generates 4-10 diverse search queries (full API param
   sets) from the user's request, expanding vague terms (e.g. "in the
   south" → GA, NC, SC, FL, etc.).
2. Queries are executed programmatically via the ``job_search`` and/or
   ``web_search`` tools.
3. Results are de-duplicated (by URL and company+title).
4. A DSPy evaluator scores each job on a 0-5 star scale with a short
   fit explanation, using the user's profile for context.
5. Jobs scoring < 3 stars are filtered out.
6. A DSPy module verifies/fixes the URL of preliminarily qualifying jobs
   to be the most direct listing link.
7. Qualifying jobs are added as search results via ``add_search_result``.

JOB_FIT_RUBRIC = """\
Score each job on a 0-5 star scale based on how well it matches the
candidate's profile.  Use the following criteria:

**5 stars — Excellent fit**
- Role title and seniority closely match the candidate's experience level.
- Required skills are a strong subset of the candidate's skills.
- Location/remote preferences are satisfied.
- Salary range (if known) aligns with the candidate's expectations.

**4 stars — Good fit**
- Most requirements match; minor gaps the candidate could reasonably
  bridge (e.g. a "nice-to-have" technology they haven't used).
- Location or salary is acceptable but not ideal.

**3 stars — Moderate fit**
- The core role is relevant, but there are notable gaps (missing a key
  required skill, seniority mismatch of ~1 level, or location is a
  stretch).
- Still worth the candidate reviewing.

**2 stars — Weak fit**
- Significant mismatches in multiple dimensions (skills, seniority,
  location, or domain).
- Unlikely to be a productive application.

**1 star — Poor fit**
- The role is tangentially related at best; most requirements do not
  align with the candidate's background.

**0 stars — No fit**
- Completely unrelated role, wrong field, or the listing is clearly
  spam/irrelevant.

When the candidate's profile is sparse or missing, be generous (default
toward 3) but still penalise obvious mismatches with the search request
itself (e.g. a nursing job when the user asked for software engineering
roles).

Always provide a 1-2 sentence ``fit_reason`` explaining the score.
