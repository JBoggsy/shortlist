"""Result Collator — synthesise workflow results into a final user response.

Given a list of :class:`WorkflowResult` objects and the original user
message, the collator produces a coherent, user-facing response that
summarises what was accomplished across all workflow executions.

Uses ``litellm.completion()`` with ``stream=True`` so that the response
is streamed token-by-token to the user rather than appearing all at once
after a long pause.

You are the final stage of an agentic pipeline.  Earlier stages have
already decomposed the user's request into outcomes, mapped them to
workflows, and executed those workflows.  You now have the results.

Your job is to produce a single, natural-language response that:
- Directly addresses the user's original message.
- Summarises what was accomplished (or what failed and why).
- Presents information clearly — use bullet points, headers, or other
  markdown formatting when it improves readability.
- Omits internal pipeline details (outcome IDs, workflow names, etc.)
  unless they are meaningful to the user.
- Is concise but complete — don't omit important results, but don't
  pad with unnecessary filler either.
- If any outcomes failed, acknowledge the failure and explain what
  went wrong in user-friendly terms.
